PROJECT ABSTRACT:
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Our project basically deals with the diabeties data set(pima data set).The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether 
or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the 
selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
CONTENT:
In this data set we have taken some attributes like The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, 
Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
ATTRIBUTES/COLUMNS:
the columns which are engaged inthe data set to predict whether diabeties is there are not are as follows:
    COLUMN                 PARICULARS
      NAME                
1.Pregnancies          Number of times pregnant
2.Glucose                 Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3.Blood	               PressureDiastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4.SkinThickness     Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5.Insulin2-Hour      serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6.BMI                       Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7.Diabetes               PedigreeFunctionDiabetes pedigree function
8.Age                        Age (years)
9.Outcome               Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0
APPROACH FOR THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
There are many approaches inorder to tackle the problem we can use any of the algorithms like k means,KNN,SVC,gaussian nb,etc.
But as per our knowledge  and ability i are following logistic regression approach.
-->LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
Logistic regression is another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics.
Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function.
Logistic regression models the probability of the default class (e.g. the first class).
For example, here we are modeling whether the people have diabeties or not from the above attributes (or) columns, then the first class 
could be diabetic and the logistic regression model could be written as the probability of diabeties given above attributes.
